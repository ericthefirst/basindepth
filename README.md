# Basin Depth Calculator #

A local rainwater harvesting guru said it would be great to have a tool that allowed a basin designer
to draw the outline of a basin, type in how many gallons of water they needed, and get the required
depth of the basin.  [This](http://www.threerightangles.com/basindepth/) is that tool... in development.

The major caveat is that the tool does not work for [concave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave) basins; basins with any sort of "dent."
That will change by January 1, and there should be some new features as well, such as support
for multiple basins, and the addition of catchment areas!

Features:
* draw a basin
* enter required number of gallons and calculate required depth
* modify the basin
  * drag vertices
  * create new vertices
  * delete vertices (right-click)
  * delete basin (right-click)

If you have a use for the tool, please submit feedback on the linked survey!
